# Legal Position & Use Boundaries

## Purpose

DulceJelly is an open-source collection of infrastructure patterns, configuration
examples, and operational guidance for self-hosted media library systems.

This project does not provide content, sources, or services. It does not include
preconfigured acquisition mechanisms. Users assemble and configure third-party
software independently.

## Scope of the Project

DulceJelly covers:
- Service orchestration (containers, networking, storage layout)
- Media library organization and metadata handling
- Observability, resilience, and backup patterns
- Secure access patterns for self-hosted services

DulceJelly does **not**:
- Distribute media content
- Provide links to content sources
- Configure trackers, indexers, or providers
- Automate or recommend content acquisition

## Dual-Use Software Acknowledgement

Some third-party applications commonly used alongside DulceJelly are capable of
retrieving files from user-defined sources.

DulceJelly:
- does not supply such sources,
- does not configure them,
- and does not instruct users on how to obtain copyrighted content.

All configuration decisions and usage outcomes are controlled entirely by the user.

## User Responsibility

Users are solely responsible for:
- how third-party software is configured,
- what sources are used,
- and ensuring compliance with applicable laws in their jurisdiction.

The maintainers of this project do not monitor, direct, or influence end-user usage.

## Licensing

All original code and documentation in this repository are licensed under the MIT License.
Third-party software referenced by this project is governed by its respective licenses.

## Good-Faith Compliance

This project is developed and maintained in good faith:
- emphasizing legitimate, non-infringing use cases,
- avoiding preconfigured acquisition workflows,
- and responding responsibly to platform or legal concerns when raised.
