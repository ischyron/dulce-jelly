  - You have to use popularity score, and criticScore from radarr data and also your knowledge of the culture and trends to determine if a film is 4K worthy.
  - 4K worthy is defined as a film with a rotten tomatoes critic score of 68% or higher and/or a signifiantly high popularity. 
  - 'HighQuality-4K' quality propfile is for visually rich films (action, animation, or where HDR/DV adds value).
  - A 4K worthy film can fallback to 'Efficient-4K' when Not HighQuality-4K worthy.  Here we prefer compact encodes (YTS is ok)
  - HD for low-popularity and low-rating or when 4K adds little value like a documentary.
  - If ReleaseGroup is currently YTS or YTS.?? and needed quality profile is HighQuality-4K; penalize YTS and favor FLUX/FraMeSToR/Hallowed.
