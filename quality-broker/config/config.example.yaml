# Natural-language hints the LLM uses alongside metadata
promptHints: |
  - Prefer HighQuality-4K for visually rich films (HDR/DV, action, animation) with good ratings.
  - Efficient-4K when 4K-worthy but prefer compact encodes (YTS/PSA ok) and metadata is modest.
  - HD for low-popularity/low-rating or when 4K adds little value.
  - Penalize YTS for HighQuality-4K; favor FLUX/FraMeSToR/Hallowed.
